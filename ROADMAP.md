### Client for Terminal: Read ROADMAP.md and Describe Tasks Annotated

Create a client for terminal that permits reading the files `ROADMAP.md` and describing what tasks are annotated in this document. The client must be able to:

*   Read the content of the file `ROADMAP.md`
*   Identify the tasks annotated in the document using the syntax `# - <task>`
*   Show a summary of the tasks annotated, including their state (`Active` or `Planned`) and description

The client must be able to run on any terminal that supports command-line interpretation (CLI). The expected behavior of the client is as follows:

*   When executing the command `roadmap`, the client will read the content of the file `ROADMAP.md`
*   Then, the client will identify the tasks annotated in the document and display them in the terminal
*   Each task will be displayed with its state (`Active` or `Planned`) and description

**Example Output**

If the file `ROADMAP.md` contains the following:

```
# üöß Active
# Q2 2023:
# - User Interface Updates
# Q3 2023:
# - Improved Performance
#
# ‚è≥ Planned
# - (In Progress) Bug Fixing
# - (In Progress) New Features Development
```

When executing the command `roadmap`, the client should display the following in the terminal:

```
Tasks annotated:
- üöß Active: User Interface Updates, Improved Performance
- ‚è≥ Planned: (In Progress) Bug Fixing, (In Progress) New Features Development
```

**Requirements**

*   The client must be able to read the content of the file `ROADMAP.md`
*   The client must identify the tasks annotated in the document using the syntax `# - <task>`
*   The client must display a summary of the tasks annotated, including their state (`Active` or `Planned`) and description
