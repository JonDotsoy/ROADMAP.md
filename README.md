# The ROADMAP.md document

This repository contains a template for creating a public roadmap for any project, detailing key milestones, goals, and timelines for development and delivery of enhancements.

The purpose of this document is to provide transparency and visibility into a project's future developments, allowing stakeholders and users to plan and prepare for upcoming changes.

To create your own ROADMAP.md file, simply copy the template below and fill it out with your project's roadmap details!

```md

If you want to get started quickly, you can also copy the template directly from this repository using the following command:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonDotsoy/ROADMAP.md/develop/template/ROADMAP.md > ROADMAP.md
```

This will download the latest version of the ROADMAP.md file and save it to a local file named `ROADMAP.md`.

## ROADMAP Command Line Interface

You can use the `roadmap` command line interface to read the tasks available in this document. To install it, run:

```bash
brew install jondotsoy/core/roadmap
```

> Consult the formula here https://github.com/JonDotsoy/homebrew-core/blob/main/roadmap.rb

To use it, simply execute:

```bash
$ roadmap
# Tasks available in ROADMAP.md:
#   Client for Terminal: Read ROADMAP.md and Describe Tasks Annotated
#   Develop Markdown Parser Library
#   UI to read roadmap on browser o webapp
```

## Initialization

You can also initialize a new roadmap using the `roadmap init` command. This will create a new file called `ROADMAP.md` in the current directory with a basic template.

```bash
$ roadmap init
# Creating new ROADMAP.md file...
# Roadmap initialized successfully!
```

## Use Cases

User stories are stored under the `use-cases` folder using the `.feature` extension. These files are written in **Gherkin** to clearly describe the desired behaviour.

Each file follows the pattern `UC-<number>-<short-title>.feature` and defines a `Feature` with one or more `Scenario` sections. The `<number>` part increments sequentially without leading zeroes (e.g. `UC-1`, `UC-2`).

Example:
For instance, `use-cases/UC-1-show-tasks.feature` documents how the CLI lists tasks.

```gherkin
Feature: Show tasks from roadmap
  Scenario: List tasks
    Given a ROADMAP.md with pending tasks
    When I run `roadmap`
    Then the CLI outputs the tasks summary
```
